[Project 1: Covid19 Deaths and Happiness report data analysis](https://github.com/arna-t/Covid19_deaths_Happiness_report)

- In this project, I preprocess and merge two datasets (Covid19 deaths, and World Happiness data) to calculate needed measures and prepare them for an Analysis.
- Analysis is to see if there is any relationship between the spread of the virus in a country and how happy people are, living in that country. - Covid19 deaths data is the cumulative number of confirmed cases, per day, in each Country. World Happiness report consists of various life factors, scored by the people living in each country.
- I used Python packages: numpy, pandas, matlib and seaborn.

- Dataset, taken from Kaggle.com, contains customer reviews on Apple Airpods on Amazon.
- Perform exploratory data analysis and plot word-cloud.
