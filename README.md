## [Project 1: Covid19 Deaths and Happiness report data analysis](https://github.com/arna-t/Covid19_deaths_Happiness_report)

- In this project, I preprocessed and merged two datasets (Covid19 deaths, and World Happiness data) to calculate needed measures and prepare them for an Analysis.
- Goal of the analysis is to determine if there is any relationship between the spread of the virus in a country and how happy people are, living in that country.
- Covid19 deaths data is the cumulative number of confirmed death, per day, in each Country. World Happiness report consists of various life factors, scored by the people living in each country.
- Python libraries used to analyze and visualize data: numpy, pandas, matpotlib, and seaborn.
